# HappyPills
HappyPills is a note-taking application that allows doctors to take down notes using Command Line Interface (CLI). 
The application replaces all physical papers and is highly optimised for fast typing users.
If you can type fast, HappyPills can help to manage patientsâ€™ records faster than traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications. 
All notes are neatly organised in HappyPills so that no information of the patients will be missing. 
Say goodbye to messy desks, illegible handwriting, time-consuming handwritten notes with HappyPills!
